    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=6B:F7:CF:38:ED:FE:77:6C:3A:05:AF:C3:81:CE:A9:43:FC:DC:3C:39%3Bca.ualberta.cs.wrkify

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    6B:F7:CF:38:ED:FE:77:6C:3A:05:AF:C3:81:CE:A9:43:FC:DC:3C:39

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    6B:F7:CF:38:ED:FE:77:6C:3A:05:AF:C3:81:CE:A9:43:FC:DC:3C:39

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
